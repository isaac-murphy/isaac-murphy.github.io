Isaac is an intern at INRIA while he finishes his M2 in computational linguistics at Universite Paris Cite. He is mainly interested in artificial dialogue and its potential applications, especially regarding social AI and human-computer interaction. He believes that by better understanding natural language generation in a dialogue setting, we can pave the way for safer and more responsible collaberation with AI-based systems. Before INRIA, he completed his Bachelorâ€™s in Linguistics at Cornell University, with a focus on the typology and morphology of indigenous Australian languages. Work aside, Isaac enjoys rock climbing and playing chess.
